# Breast-Cancer-Binary-Classification
Developed a nonlinear classifier with Boosting and a linear classifier using SVM with a "reject" option.

1. Dataset: the breast cancer dataset from scikit-learn library. It is a classic binary classifcation dataset from the UCI Machine learning repsitory. The dataset contains 569 samples with labels “malignant” or “benign” denoting the state of the tumor cells. Each tumor cell is described by a 30-
dimensional feature vector that was extracted from digitized images of the cell nuclei. Given a new cell (represented by a 30-dimensional feature vector), the goal is to predict whether the cell is malignant or benign.

2. Main purpose: practice and understand Adaboosting algorithm. practice and understand support vector

I have to finish it later.
